# Specifications Index

This directory contains the feature specifications and sprint documents that
govern all work in this repository. Every feature flows through the same
lifecycle: spec → sprint doc → implementation → QA. The full explanation of
this process is in
[docs/foundation/orchestration-method.md](../foundation/orchestration-method.md).

### Archived Workstreams

Four completed workstreams have been moved to
[docs/\_archive/](../_archive/README.md) to reduce student-facing clutter.
They are still in the repository and demonstrate the same workflow:

| Workstream                                                              | Sprints | What It Built                                                                               |

## Recommended Study Order

For students learning the agentic orchestration method, study these completed
workstreams in this order:

1. **[browser-enhancements](refactor/browser-enhancements/)** — cleanest
   example of the full cycle. Five focused sprints, CSS-only scope, clear
   traceability from the spec's evidence table to `@supports` gates in code.
   Start with `spec.md`, then read sprints 0 through 4.

2. **[code-quality](refactor/code-quality/)** — shows how to audit existing
   code, identify concrete problems (43 hardcoded color values, monolithic
   components, DRY violations), and plan targeted refactors across 5 sprints.

3. **[documentation-foundation](documentation-foundation/)** — shows how
   documentation itself can be specified and staged. The spec defines the
   problem (no onboarding, no tech orientation, no process docs), and the
   sprints deliver the four foundation documents now in `docs/foundation/`.

## How To Read A Workstream

For any workstream you want to study:

1. Read `spec.md` first — it defines the problem, design goals, and sprint
   plan
2. Read the sprint docs in order (`sprint-0-*.md` through the final sprint)
3. Look at the code the sprints produced — the sprint doc tells you which
   files were created or modified
4. Note the QA pass sprint (usually the last one) — it shows how verification
   works as a separate disciplined pass
