          Modern systems can sound authoritative, helpful, and impressively
          general. That does not mean historians or engineers should treat
          fluent output as proof that the underlying problem of machine
          understanding is solved. Era 7 is partly about how public deployment
          made that distinction much harder to ignore.

              <p>
                Era 7 is not best understood as a generic victory lap for bigger
                models. The stronger historical claim is that pretrained
                transformer systems become reusable bases for many downstream
                tasks, which turns a research architecture into a platform
                model. That is why the concept of a foundation model matters
                more than a simple list of brand names.
              </p>
              <p>
                Public deployment changes the era just as much as scaling does.
                Once conversational systems, coding tools, retrieval pipelines,
                and multimodal assistants enter ordinary workflows, debates over
                trust, labor, governance, and educational use move from the edge
                of AI history into the center of it. This repository therefore
                teaches the current period through its 2026 horizon, not as an
                unlimited present.

      >
        <p>
          In plain language, embeddings let systems turn words, documents,
          images, or other items into dense vectors so similar things can be
          found near each other. Latent space is the teaching idea that names
          this internal representational neighborhood. That is why retrieval and
          semantic similarity matter so much in modern AI stacks. If this is the
          point where the chapter becomes too technical, step into the{" "}

      >
        <p>
          Modern LLMs are not mysterious in every sense. Researchers know a
          great deal about their training setup, scaling behavior, and many
          regularities in what they can do. But that is not the same as a clean
          mechanistic account of the internal circuits producing each behavior.
          Era 7 therefore includes a real interpretability gap: systems are
          useful and deployable before they are deeply understood.
