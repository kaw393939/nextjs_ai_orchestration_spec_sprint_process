            The first mistake to avoid is thinking an embedding is a secret
            symbolic definition stored inside the model. It is better understood
            as a learned coordinate system that makes similarity and retrieval
            computationally useful.

              The modern period feels less mysterious once readers see that
              embeddings are the continuation of a long move toward learned
              representations. Era 5 makes that move technically credible, Era 6
              makes it dominant, and Era 7 turns it into infrastructure that
              powers retrieval, assistants, and multimodal systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              That still leaves an important limit. Explaining vectors and
              similarity does not mean we have a complete mechanistic account of
              every behavior inside a large language model. The math bridge is
              meant to improve understanding, not to erase the interpretability
              gap discussed elsewhere in the site.
